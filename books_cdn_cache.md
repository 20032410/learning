1.  Reducing capital expense. There is no needfor individuals or organizations to spend huge resources to build up their own data centers, including hardware, software, or licensing fees. They only pay when they consume computing resources, and for how much they consume.
2. cloud CDN was pro- posed as an architecture that migrates CDN into the cloud.
3. By merging RAN and cloud computing together, C-RANs have been proposed as a prospective architecture for 5G. A typical structure of C-RAN consists of three com- ponents: baseband unit (BBU) pool, fronthaul links, and remote radio heads (RRHs).
4. The overall network structure of cloud CCMN.
5. the BBU pool of C-RAN consists of many gen- eral-purpose servers, and each server has two main resources: computation resource (e.g., CPU and memory) and storage resource (e.g., hard disks).
